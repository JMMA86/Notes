Design a Turing machine M that computes the subtraction function, in unary notation. This function takes two arguments, $h(n, m) = n − m$, where $n, m ≥ 1$ and $n > m$. With input $1^n\text{ }1^m$, $M$ should produce as output $1^{n−m}$. The sequences of ones, $1^n$ and $1^m$, represent the natural numbers $n$ and $m$, respectively.
