### Alphabets
This are finite sets of symbols, the symbol $\Sigma$ is used to represent them. (always use the {} to delimit them)

### Strings
Sequence of symbols chosen from an alphabet, the minimal string is $\lambda$ which is a set with no symbols from an alphabet. A string has a length, and its exactly what it means. 

### String's power
Is the concatenation of a single element: $a^2 = aa$. 

### Alphabets power
Represents all the possibilities to form a string with an n length: $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$ $\Sigma^2 = \{aa, bb, ab, ba\}$

$\Sigma^*$ Means all the elements with all the possible powers that can be made.

Sigma plus: $\Sigma^+ = \Sigma^* - \lambda$ 

Concatenations works as in mathematics.

Substrings = cp substring

### Languages
A language L over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is a subset of $\Sigma^*$, a set of specific combinations. It has all the operations of a set.

A,B = AB = BA = A = {a, aa} B = {aa, a} {a, aa, aa, a} {aa, a, a, aa}

A language can be decomposited in this way: $A = uv$
