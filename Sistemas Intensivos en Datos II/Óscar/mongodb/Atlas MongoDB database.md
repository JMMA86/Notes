MongoDB uses documents, which are similar to json files.

Things like this are the thing that we are going to retrieve from a consult.

```json
{
	"_id": 1,
	"name": {
		"first": "Ada",
		"last": "lovelace",
	},
	"tittle": "The first programmer",
	"interests": ["mathematics", "programming"]
}
```

The strong aspect of using documents is that we are going to be able to represent both model and data in a single file.

It can be used for:
- Personal projects
- Start-ups
- Enterprise applications

The components of a mongoDB are:
- Document (Smallest unit)
- Collection (A grouping of documents)
- Database (A container for collections)
