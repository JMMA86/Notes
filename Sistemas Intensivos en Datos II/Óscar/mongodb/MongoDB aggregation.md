# Introduction to MongoDB Aggregation

This section contains key definitions for this lesson, as well as the code for an aggregation pipeline.

## Definitions

- **Aggregation**: Collection and summary of data
- **Stage**: One of the built-in methods that can be completed on the data, but does not permanently alter it
- **Aggregation pipeline**: A series of stages completed on the data in order
    

## Structure of an Aggregation Pipeline

```json
db.collection.aggregate([
    {
        $stage1: {
            { expression1 },
            { expression2 }...
        },
        $stage2: {
            { expression1 }...
        }
    }
])
```

# Using `$match` and `$group` Stages in a MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline

Review the following sections, which show the code for the `$match` and `$group` aggregation stages.

## `$match`

The `$match` stage filters for documents that match specified conditions. Here's the code for `$match`:

```json
{
  $match: {
     "field_name": "value"
  }
}
```

## `$group`

The `$group` stage groups documents by a group key.

```json
{
  $group:
    {
      _id: <expression>, // Group key
      <field>: { <accumulator> : <expression> }
    }
 }
```

## `$match` and `$group` in an Aggregation Pipeline

The following aggregation pipeline finds the documents with a field named "state" that matches a value "CA" and then groups those documents by the group key "$city" and shows the total number of zip codes in the state of California.

```json
db.zips.aggregate([
{   
   $match: { 
      state: "CA"
    }
},
{
   $group: {
      _id: "$city",
      totalZips: { $count : { } }
   }
}
])
```

# Using `$sort` and `$limit` Stages in a MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline

Review the following sections, which show the code for the `$sort` and `$limit` aggregation stages.

## `$sort`

The `$sort` stage sorts all input documents and returns them to the pipeline in sorted order. We use 1 to represent ascending order, and -1 to represent descending order.

```json
{
    $sort: {
        "field_name": 1
    }
}
```

  

## `$limit`

The `$limit` stage returns only a specified number of records.

```json
{
  $limit: 5
}
```

  

## `$sort` and `$limit` in an Aggregation Pipeline

The following aggregation pipeline sorts the documents in descending order, so the documents with the greatest `pop` value appear first, and limits the output to only the first five documents after sorting.

```json
db.zips.aggregate([
{
  $sort: {
    pop: -1
  }
},
{
  $limit:  5
}
])
```

# Using `$project`, `$count`, and `$set` Stages in a MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline

Review the following sections, which show the code for the `$project`, `$set`, and `$count` aggregation stages.

## `$project`

The `$project` stage specifies the fields of the output documents. 1 means that the field should be included, and 0 means that the field should be supressed. The field can also be assigned a new value.

```
{
    $project: {
        state:1, 
        zip:1,
        population:"$pop",
        _id:0
    }
}
```

## `$set`

The `$set` stage creates new fields or changes the value of existing fields, and then outputs the documents with the new fields.

```
{
    $set: {
        place: {
            $concat:["$city",",","$state"]
        },
        pop:10000
     }
  }
```

## `$count`

The `$count` stage creates a new document, with the number of documents at that stage in the aggregation pipeline assigned to the specified field name.

```
{
  $count: "total_zips"
}
```

## `$out`

Writes the documents that are returned by an aggregation pipeline into a collection
